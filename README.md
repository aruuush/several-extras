# Several Extras

## Several Raids

Adds custom filters to Raids page.

Filters include:
- Grey out raids where 100/100 shards have been collected (Incomplete skins are ignored)
- Grey out 3 star girls with less than 40 shards obtained
- Grey out raids with higher villain ID than last villain (Requires you to open the villain page of HH++ at least once after installing this script)
- DON'T grey out seasons raids (So it will show even incomplete skins or 3 star girls with less than 40 shards obtained)
- Has option to hide all greyed out raids completely (Tho Several QoL has done this one better (On the top of the raids page and easy to toggle))

Removes a few unnecessary things to make it less cluttered.

- An ad from Market page which blocks part of the filter (Not useful for card holders)
- Keep only 4 slots labyrinth (Yeah kinda useless)
- Champions girl from Champions page
- Claim All button from PD page

Bonus:
- Change all girl images to Pokemons (Credits to Zoopokemon)
